All instruments are "Easy Gauge" instruments that I have created myself. 

* License terms
You may use, change or republish the files free of charge. When republishing 
you must mention the source ("Easy Gauges" by Tetrachromat) and provide 
a link to the repository (https://github.com/Cr4O13/easy-gauges).

* Images
All image files (background and some cover images) are created by myself. 
But the instruments require additional (cover, bezel and needle) images. 

As I have reused images from Air Manager community instruments, I cannot 
redistribute them here. You need to create those images yourself or also 
reuse images from Air Manager community instruments. Such images are located
in the instruments 'resources' folder. Choose one that matches best.

The preview image is a (reduced) screenshot of the instrument, as it appears
with the images I have choosen.

* JSON instrument specification
If you are new to "Easy Gauges" I strongly recommend to read at least the
"Concepts" section of the user manual, to familiarize yourself with the 
features and terminology of "Easy Gauges".

* Support "Easy Gauges"
I would really apreciate any comments on your experiences with "Easy Gauges". 
Be it 
- features that don't work as you expect
- features that you are missing
- features that need more explanations in the user manual

You can leave a post on the topics I have created in the Air Manager forums.
For additional support you can send a PM to "Tetrachromat".

If you think "Easy Gauges" are useful, please spread the word on other platforms!

Thank you.
