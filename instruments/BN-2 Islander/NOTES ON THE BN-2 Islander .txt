A NOTE ON THE BN-2 ISLANDER by BLACKBOCKSIMULATIONS

The instruments in this folder have been created for the Britten-Norman 
BN-2 Islander by BlackBoxSimulations for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.

Unfortunately many instruments in the 3D-cockpit of this aircraft do not 
show the value that you can subscribe to from Air Manager. 

But when flying the aircraft, it appeares as if the values shown in the 
3D-cockpit are correct for many flight situations. One can assume 
the systems simulation by BlackBoxSimulations is at fault, and the 
instruments have been tweaked/faked to show the expected values.

I had to replicate the tweaks to have the "Easy Gauges" show the same 
values as the instrument in the 3D-cockpit. To achieve this I used an
advanced feature from "Easy Gauges":
Some "gauge" specifications contain a "sections" field that allows to 
tweak the indications. This should be used for such exceptional cases only. 
In all other cases, the "scale" reference index gives the best indication.
